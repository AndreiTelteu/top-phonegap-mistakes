### Current Tripping Points to Cordova/Phonegap ###
Date: 2015-09-25

1. No support for iOS9 YET!

'''PhoneGap Build iOS 9 Support Status'''
* Sept 23, 2015
* http://community.phonegap.com/nitobi/topics/phonegap-build-ios-9-support-status
* Top line: iOS 9 is not officially supported until Cordova-iOS 4.0.0, which the Cordova team is hard at work on. However some issues can be solved with some simple configuration changes. 

> At this point in time, 4 bugs are reported to the Cordova Bug repository. Your issue does not appear in the respository - as of this date.

 * 4 bugs - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-9684?jql=text%20~%20%22iOS9%22
 * 1 bug - https://openradar.appspot.com/22186109

  Regardless, of what you are using, as the forum post states iOS 9 is not officially supported until Cordova-iOS 4.0.0. This means, create a work around, or wait until it is officially supported. OR file a bug report with cordova. OR wait until someone else creates a work around.

  Sometimes Phonegap makes announcements on the forum and not the blog.<br />
