"""
Apple: We've identified a group of apps that are using a third-party advertising SDK, developed by '''Youmi''', a mobile advertising provider, that uses private APIs to gather private information, such as user email addresses and device identifiers, and route data to its company server. This is a violation of our security and privacy guidelines. The apps using Youmi's SDK will be removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected.

"""
As described in Rodriguez's proof-of-concept '''video''' the procedure takes advantage of an apparent bug related to Siri lock screen access and iOS 9's five-attempt lockout policy. Under a specific set of circumstances invoking Siri from an iPhone or iPad's lock screen grants limited system access.

We have noticed a couple of OS regressions between iOS 8.4.1 and iOS 9 which have been reported to Apple.

This is not resolved in the iOS 9 release.
