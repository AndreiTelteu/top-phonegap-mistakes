The PhoneGap Desktop App is the easiest way to get started with PhoneGap. It is an alternative to the PhoneGap CLI, yet it uses the same libraries under-the-hood. It requires Windows or Mac.

The major steps are:

1. Creates a template
2. Runs a server
3. Pairs with local device
4. Edit and see changes on device.
