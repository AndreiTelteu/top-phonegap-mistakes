2. Does not read the docs.
3. Does not follow the blogs.
4. In the code, did not listen for the 'deviceready' event.
5. When designing the app, thinks phonegap works like a website.
6. Not setting "phonegap-version" in config.xml.
7. Not setting "version" for you plugins in config.xml.
8. Forgot to add the plugin to config.xml.
9. Using an online example for *phonegap CLI* and then using *phonegap Build*.

## Frustrating Issues for the Volunteers ##


1. Not knowing if the person posting the question is using a CLI, an IDE, or Phonegap Build.
2. Plugins don't work.
3. Getting confused by the different versions of documentation.
4. The documentation is a mess.
5. Some APIs have shifted over time because of political issues.
6. The definition for using config.xml is different for ''Cordova'', ''Phonegap'', and ''Phonegap Build''.


1. **Not knowing if the person posting the question is using a CLI, an IDE, or Phonegap Build.**<p />In theory, phonegap works with a varitey of IDEs, but it also supports a CLI (Command Line Interface). This creates multiple issues. The largest is the environment is not setup correctly. This happens most often with MS Windows, but it also happens with Linux. Not so much on iOS (any more).
2. **Plugins don't work.**<p />There is not much we can do expect help you understand the configuration as defined by the author of the plugin. Too often the plugin becomes neglectware and we are both stuck. In this case, choose another plugin.
3. **Getting confused by the different versions of documentation.**<p />It is easy to get confused when looking at the ''Phonegap'' documentation and NOT REALIZE that there is documentation for ''Phonegap Build''
4. **The documentation is a mess.**<p />Luckily the leading edge documentation is mostly correct.
5. **Some APIs have shifted over time because of political issues.**<p />File, File Storage, and File Transfer is the classic example of this issue. Please read the documentation carefully.
6. **The definition for using config.xml is different for ''Cordova'', ''Phonegap'', and ''Phonegap Build''.**<p />Although they are very similar, they are different. Please read the documentation.
